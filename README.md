# Fortrex
A 2D tower defense game written in C# .NET v4.5!

#Upcoming/Priorities (2/11/15)
prjFortrex.Client - Needs visuals and a basic implementation of a player that can move.
prjFortrex.GameEngine - Missing large portions of the game engine.
prjFortrex.Server - Once the player is further defined in the game engine, modify the
                    server to manipulate the objects differently.
prjFortrex.Tools - Low priority: Will be implemented after basic client is functional.
